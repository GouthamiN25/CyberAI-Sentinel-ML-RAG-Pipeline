## ⭐ AI-Powered Cyber Analytics with RAG + Threat Intelligence Dashboard

CyberAI Sentinel is an end-to-end AI system that transforms raw cybersecurity incident logs into actionable insights using Machine Learning, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

This project simulates a modern SOC (Security Operations Center) workflow by combining:

Supervised ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Threat scoring system (0–100)

Behavioral visual analytics (heatmaps, timelines, distributions)

A fully integrated RAG copilot that retrieves and explains incidents using natural language

Optional LLM analysis for SOC-like reasoning

It provides a single platform for:

Threat detection

Incident pattern discovery

Risk scoring

Semantic search

Generative AI–powered threat analysis
